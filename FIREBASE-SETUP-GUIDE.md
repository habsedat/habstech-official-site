## üéØ **What the Image Assignment System Does**

The system I created allows you to:

1. **Upload Images**: Go to `/admin/media` and upload images
2. **Assign Images Visually**: Go to `/admin/image-assignment` and click on website sections to assign images
3. **See Results**: Images automatically appear on your public website

### **Simple Workflow:**
1. Upload an image in the admin dashboard
2. Go to the visual assignment page
3. Click on the image you want to assign
4. Click on the website section where you want it to appear
5. The image automatically shows up on your public website

This replaces the need to hardcode image paths or manually edit code.

## üö® **If You're Still Confused**

The system is designed to be simple:
- **Upload** ‚Üí **Click to Assign** ‚Üí **Done**

No technical knowledge required. Just visual clicking to assign images to website sections.
